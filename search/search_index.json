You can use this demonstration to learn about Security Hub's capabilities. Agenda 20 minutes Summary Page Multi-Account Hierarchy Integrations Insights Explore Security Standards Security Hub Summary Page The Security Hub Summary page gives you an overview of security and compliance status of your AWS account(s). Some of the data in your account may differ from the screenshots and some maybe blank. From the AWS Console click Services in the top left corner Type Security Hub in the services search bar. Select Security Hub from the list. Click Summary on the left hand navigation. Security Hub automatically enables subscriptions to GuardDuty and Inspector. Also collected, but not used in this workshop are findings from Macie, IAM Access Analyzer, and Firewall Manager. Observe the Passed and Failed status of the CIS AWS Foundations . Even though you just enabled it a few minutes ago, partial results of the 43 total checks have been collected. Scroll down to the graphs under Insights (Your graphs maybe different). Move your mouse over New findings over time by provider and observe the 3 sources of findings that Security Hub is already collecting. (There will be more throughout this workshop) Scroll down further under Insights . Move your mouse over Accounts with the most findings (by resource type) and observe the sorted list of AWS resources that have findings to investigated. Multi Account Hierarchy An AWS Security Hub administrator account can view data from and manage configuration for its member accounts. The Security Hub administrator-member relationship is established differently based on whether the accounts belong to an organization in AWS Organizations. If you are integrated with Organizations, the organization management account designates the Security Hub administrator account, which becomes the administrator account. The Security Hub administrator account automatically has access to all of the accounts in the organization. The Security Hub administrator account determines which accounts in the organization to enable as member accounts. These member accounts cannot disassociate themselves from the Security Hub administrator account. If you are not integrated with Organizations, member accounts accept an invitation from a administrator account. A Security Hub administrator account for an organization can also invite member accounts that are not part of the organization. Accounts that are added by invitation can disassociate themselves from their administrator account. In this section we will add a member account to your Workshop Security Hub Account. These instructions use sample information and will not actually setup the Multi-Account Hierarchy. (Optional)You can invite another AWS account you are the owner of to enable AWS Security Hub and become associated with your Workshop AWS account. In the steps below, instead of false data use information for another you AWS account you own, you can accept the invitation, and you can enable Security Hub. Click Settings on the left hand navigation. Click + Add accounts above the empty account table. Enter 111122223333 (Four 1's, 2's, & 3's) in the Account ID field. Enter a valid formatted email address . (for this example it doesn't have to be a real email.) Click Add Click Next Click Invite in the Status field of the member accounts table. Click Invite . At this point a user with the appropriate permissions in the destination AWS account could accept this invite from the master account Integrations In this section, we will walk through the Security Hub side of enabling a partner integration. Security Hub provides the ability to integrate security findings from AWS services and third-party products. For third-party products Security Hub gives you the ability to selectively enable the integrations and provides a link to the configuration instructions related to the third-party product. Security Hub detects and consolidates only those security findings from the supported AWS and partner product integrations that are generated after Security Hub is enabled in your AWS accounts. It doesn't retroactively detect and consolidate security findings that were generated before you enabled Security Hub. Click on Integrations from the left-hand navigation pane. Scroll through the list of available integrations. Return to the top and search for Cloud Custodian . Click Accept Findings . Review the permissions required for the integration. Click Accept findings . This will put in place a service policy allowing the partner solution to send finding information into this account. For the purposes of this workshop a Cloud Custodian instance is already set up to automatically send findings to the integration you just enabled. To use other partner integrations in your account, you would still need to complete the Configure step in the partner solution so findings that are created by the partner solution are sent to Security Hub. Findings Security Hub imports findings AWS security services, third-party product integrations that you enable, and custom integrations you build. Security Hub consumes these findings using a standard findings format called AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF), which eliminates the need for time-consuming data conversion efforts. Security Hub then correlates the findings across integrated products to prioritize the most important ones. For more information about the findings format, see AWS Security Finding Format . Click on Findings from the left-hand navigation pane. Click in the Search bar and select Severity label and enter MEDIUM (it must be all capitalized). Click Apply . Select a Title of any finding to see more information. Click the arrow next to Resources on bottom right. Click the [+] to the right of this findings Resource Type (e.g. AWSEc2Instance). this will add it as a filter to the search. Insights A Security Hub Insight is a collection of related findings defined by an aggregation statement and optional filters. An insight identifies a security area that requires attention and intervention. Security Hub offers several managed (default) insights that you can't modify or delete. You can also create custom insights to track security issues unique to your AWS environment and usage. Click on Insights from the left-hand navigation pane. Filter for insight severity . Click on 24. Severity by counts of findings . The Group By: Resource Id in the filter is what makes this an Insight Select a Severity Label (e.g. Critical) to see the underlying finding(s). Security Standards Security Hub currently supports multiple security standards: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) v3.2.1: The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) standard in Security Hub consists of a set of AWS security best practices controls. Each control applies to a specific AWS resource, and relates to one or more PCI DSS version 3.2.1 requirements. A PCI DSS requirement can be related to multiple controls. The details page for each PCI DSS control lists the specific PCI DSS requirements that are related to that control.The PCI DSS Compliance Standard in Security Hub is designed to help you with your ongoing PCI DSS security activities. The controls cannot verify whether your systems are compliant with the PCI DSS standard. They can neither replace internal efforts nor guarantee that you will pass a PCI DSS assessment. AWS Foundational Security Best Practices v1.0.0: The AWS Foundational Security Best Practices standard is a set of controls that detect when your deployed accounts and resources deviate from security best practices. The controls include best practices from across multiple AWS services. Each control belongs to one of the following categories, which are based on the functions described in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Center for Internet Security (CIS) AWS Foundations v1.2.0: AWS Security Hub has satisfied the requirements of CIS Security Software Certification and is hereby awarded CIS Security Software Certification for the following CIS Benchmarks: CIS Benchmark for CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark, v1.2.0, Level 1 and Level 2 To run the CIS AWS Foundations standard's compliance checks on your environment's resources, Security Hub either runs through the exact audit steps prescribed for the checks in Securing Amazon Web Services or uses specific AWS Config managed rules. Therefore, for the CIS AWS Foundations standard to be functional in Security Hub, when you enable it in a particular account, you must also enable AWS Config in that account. Security Hub doesn't manage AWS Config for you. For this workshop Config has already been enabled for you. The first round of compliance checks will be done within 2 hours of enabling security hub and then runs every 12 hours. Click on Security standards . Note the Security score should have changed from when you first enabled the CIS standard. If your score shows 0% or -, disable and then re-enable the security standards.

This custom findings feature gives customers the flexibility to build their security checks against their AWS environment and import them into Security Hub. In the environment for this workshop, multiple sources that are sending custom findings into Security Hub: * The open-source Cloud Custodian project running on an EC2 instance. * A Config Rule checking for non-compliant AMIs. * A Lambda function looking for non-compliant secrets. This module will guide you on how to either view or fully integrate these findings sources into Security Hub. Agenda Create Custom Findings with AWS Config - 15 min Create Custom Insight for Custom Findings - 10 min Create Custom Findings with AWS Config In this section we will cover how you can create your own findings in Security Hub. The foundation for this section will be using AWS Config Rules to identify compliance violations and then posting those violations into Security Hub. This is a representation of the architecture you will be implementing: For this part of the workshop a Config rule has already been defined. The specific Config rule being used is approved-amis-by-id . This rule looks for EC2 instances backed by AMIs that are not in the rule's list of approved AMIs. Any EC2 instances that are not using an AMI that is in the approved list will be reported by the rule as noncompliant. Create EventBridge Rule This section creates the rule which will catch messages sent from Config rules about noncompliant resources and route them to a target. Navigate to the Amazon EventBridge Console. Click on the Create rule on the right side. In the Create rule page give your rule a name and a description that represents the rule's purpose. All Config Rule output is sent as events to the AWS default event bus. The define pattern section allows you to identify filters to take a specific action when matched events appear.

Feel free to look at the function to learn more about how it integrates with Security Hub. Click Create . Create a rule to track approved AMIs This section will run the Config rule to generate information on noncompliant resources and send them to Security Hub. Navigate to the AWS Config dashboard From the Config Dashboard click Rules on the left menu. Make sure to not choose Rules from the Aggregated view menu. This requires Config Aggregator and this feature is not used in this workshop. In the Rules page there will be one rule named approved-amis-by-id . Click on the rule name to go to the detail page for that rule. In the rule detail screen you will see the rule configured with a list of approved AMIs. There will also be one resource showing as noncompliant. Now that the EventBridge is in place you want to see the noncompliant instances show in Security Hub as a finding. Click on the Delete results button. In the confirmation popup click Delete . Click on the refresh button in the Choose resources in scope section. The noncompliant resource section should now be empty. Click the Re-evaluate button. You will get a message that the Config rule is in use and that you need to refresh the page. At this point you can either refresh the entire page in your browser or use the refresh button in the Choose resources in scope section of the page. An instance should now be showing as noncompliant in the Choose resources in scope section. This re-run of the Config rule will trigger the EventBridge rule that is looking for noncompliant resources, resulting in the finding showing in Security Hub. Clearing results and re-evaluating the Config rule is being done to help force sending findings into Security Hub for this workshop. Under normal circumstances you will not need manually run the Config rule in order to get findings to show in Security Hub. Once you have the Config and EventBridge rules configured, new noncompliant resources will automatically flow into Security Hub as a Config rule finds noncompliant resources. View the noncompliant AMI finding in Security Hub Navigate to the Security Hub dashboard. Click on the Findings option in the left-hand navigate menu. You should see a rule towards the top of the findings list with a Company of Personal and a Title about an unapproved AMI for an instance. This is the result of your compliance rule and its integration with EventBridge. Click on the Title link for the finding to view more details for your finding. You now have a setup in place that helps demonstrate how you can send custom findings into Security Hub using AWS data sources and EventBridge rules. In your environment the Lambda function find-secrets-without-rotation checks for secrets that have a rotation time that is beyond the max days parameter on the function. When secrets are found with a rotation time beyond what is defined in the function a finding is created in Security Hub. Take some time to explore the Lambda function to see how you can directly send custom findings into Security Hub. Create Custom Insights for Custom Findings This section will walk you through how to create a custom insight to give you more visibility around the sources that are sending findings into Security Hub for custom findings. When a custom finding is sent into Security Hub it will have a company of Personal and a product of Default . Unlike integrations from AWS services and approved 3rd parties, you cannot use the Company and/or Product fields to determine the source of your finding for custom findings. However, Security Hub provides the ability to create insights that filter on more attributes than you can see from the initial findings console. You can filter on additional attributes that are passed in as part of a finding that enable you to get more granular in how you filter findings. For this lab the custom findings have been built to utilize the Generator ID field in the AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF) to help in identifying sources of findings. Navigate to the Security Hub dashboard. Choose Insights from the left hand navigation. Click Create insight . Click in the filter field at the top to add additional filters. Choose a filter field of Company name . Choose a filter match type of IS and a value of Personal . Choose a filter field of Product name . Choose a filter match type of IS and a value of Default . Choose a Grouping of Group by: . In the list of options choose Generator ID . Click on Create insight to save your custom insight.

Click on the Create rule on the right side. In the Create rule page give your rule a name and a description that represents the rule's purpose. All Security Hub findings are sent as events to the AWS default event bus. The define pattern section allows you to identify filters to take a specific action when matched events appear. Under Define pattern, select Event pattern . Select Pre-defined pattern by service . In the drop down for Service Provider , select AWS . In the drop down for Service Name , select or type and select Security Hub . In the drop down for Event type choose Security Hub Finding \u2013 Custom Action . In the Event Pattern window click the Edit button. Add in the resources line as shown below, making sure to copy in the ARN of your Custom Event . Click Save . Note the comma after the bracket before the resources definition. Copy and paste in the custom event pattern below. Use the ARN you recorded for your Security Hub Custom Action { \"source\": [ \"aws.securityhub\" ], \"detail-type\": [ \"Security Hub Findings - Custom Action\" ], \"resources\": [ \"arn:aws:securityhub:us-east-1:[YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID]:action/custom/shslaction\" ] } Under Select targets, select Lambda function . Then select the sechub-to-slack lambda function. Click Create . Update the Lambda Function to send messages to Slack The last step in this setup is to update the environment variables of your lambda function so that notifications can be sent to the correct Slack workspace. Navigate to the Lambda console. In the list of functions choose the sechub-to-slack function. Scroll down to environment variables and click Edit Fill in: slackChannel: the value from the Slack channel you created earlier in this workshop. webHookUrl: URL of the webhook for the Slack setup you created earlier in this workshop. Click Save . Testing the Integration between Security Hub and Slack At this point, you are now able to start using a Security Hub custom action to send Findings to Slack. Go to Security Hub Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/securityhub Click on Findings option, and the Findings screen will show a list of all your open Security Hub findings. Choose any one of the findings and then select the Send to Slack custom action from the Actions drop down. A success message appears indicating the event was sent to CloudWatch events. Your custom actions drop down list will have more options than displayed here. In Slack , navigate to your channel to see the finding that was sent from Security Hub. Enable Custom Action to add Tag data as Notes to Security Hub Findings In this section you will follow the same pattern of creating a Security Hub custom action and EventBridge rule to Lambda. The custom Lambda function will look up the tags for an EC2 instance, and the resulting tag information will be added to the selected Security Hub finding as a note. Create Security Hub Custom Action Navigate to the Security Hub dashboard . In the left-hand navigation pane choose Settings . Choose the Custom actions tab. Click the Create custom action button. Enter an Action Name (Displayed in the Security Hub Console), Action Description , and an Action ID of \"getTags\". Click Create custom action . Copy the Custom action ARN that was generated for your custom finding. You will need the custom action ARN in the next steps. Create a EventBridge Rule to capture Security Hub Custom action Navigate to the Amazon EventBridge Console. Click on the Create rule on the right side. In the Create rule page give your rule a name and a description that represents the rule's purpose. Under Define pattern, select Event pattern . Select Pre-defined pattern by service . In the drop down for Service Provider , select AWS . In the drop down for Service Name , select or type and select Security Hub . In the drop down for Event type choose Security Hub Finding \u2013 Custom Action . In the Event Pattern window click the Edit button. Add in the resources line as shown below, making sure to copy in the ARN of your Custom Event . Click Save . Note the comma after the bracket before the resources definition. Copy and paste in the custom event pattern below. Use the ARN you recorded for your Security Hub Custom Action { \"source\": [ \"aws.securityhub\" ], \"detail-type\": [ \"Security Hub Findings - Custom Action\" ], \"resources\": [ \"arn:aws:securityhub:us-east-1:[YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID]:action/custom/getTags\" ] } Under Select targets, ensure Lambda function is populated in the top drop down and then select enrich-sec-hub-finding lambda function. Click Create . Test your enrichment rule Navigate to the Security Hub Dashboard . In the left-hand navigation pane choose Findings . Click in the search space to Add filters , and find Resource Type . Add AwsEc2Instance (case sensitive) after EQUALS and click Apply . Click the Title of the first finding in the list and observe that there are currently no notes in this finding. Click the check box to the left of this same finding. Click the Actions down arrow and select your new custom action (Get Tag Information) to add tags to the notes of this finding. Refresh your browser. Click the Title of the first finding again, and this time view the Notes. What other data would you add to findings ad-hoc or automatically? How would you edit the EventBridge rule to have the enrich function run every time a new finding is created, instead of manually initiated?
